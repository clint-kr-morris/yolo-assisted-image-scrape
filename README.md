I created this repo for mass data collection for deep learning models. In particular, I have been testing how [SCAN (Learning to Classify Images without Labels)]( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12320.pdf) compares to traditional methods.

Due to the reduced effort required to train a SCAN model it is advantageous to collect mass data for model training.
